### Portfolio

On-going development of my professional portfolio. Built with React

- I love design and creative coding has been one outlet for creativity.
- This is somewhere I can showcase my design skills and developer skills which is super cool.

_theme and fonts are inspired by monkeytype.com (a great place to practice typing)_

#### currently working on:

- creating a project card for displaying project demos, and information
- experience spotlight, highlighting what I have done in my past internships

#### todos:

- [ ] add more information about myself (customization)
- [ ] integrate github api for current opensource projects
- [ ] create a full backend for emailing and contacting
- [ ] add pages for other projects like stock checkers, ticker suggestions, etc... (any projects i do)

#### possible but not likely:

- [x] convert javascript -> typescript (thank you AI)

#### how to run dev:
